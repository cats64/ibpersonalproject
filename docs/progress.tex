In this document, an event on the schedule will be shown with my progress next to it, and notes on how I got there. The schedule of events for this project go as follows:
\newline
\newline
First phase:
\begin{itemize}
 \item Due by October 1st: First source in Noodletools, at least 50 lines of code.
 \item Due by October 26th: 100 lines of code, OS should at least print to screen. Complete research, all sources in Noodletools
 \item Due by November 2nd: Make sure all missing work is done and make sure the OS boots in a virtual machine. At least 200 lines of code at this point. Buy any other needed books and supplies for the project by this point, with the exeption of a PS/2 keyboard (for reasons too technical to explain fully).
\end{itemize}
All goals in this section have been met and I have moved onto the next section.
Second phase:
\begin{itemize}
 \item Due by November 16th: Split up code into different sections, ensure that at least 250 lines have been written. Make sure that the code compiles on other operating systems.
 \item Due by November 30th: Ensure that the code actually boots on real hardware, begin work on PS/2 keyboard driver.
 \item Due by December 7th: Buy a PS/2 keyboard by this date; test it after purchasing it. Complete shell and some basic apps to reflect what it can do.
 \item Due by December 21st: Complete PS/2 keyboard input and setup the boot process to read from it. We now have two way input to the user; keyboard drivers are extremely difficult and I do not expect for this to work fully.
 \item Due by January 4th of 2021: Wrap up development, freeze new commits to the Github repository and begin any work needed for Super Sunday/final presentation.
\end{itemize}
I have my code building on other operating systems and Linux distributions. It has been tested on my i686 machine and runs fine. SimpleOS also runs fine in VirtualBox, GNOME Boxes and QEMU. The plan is that over the next week of Thanksgiving break, I will be creating more code and working on it. I also plan to update this folder with more details about the OSes inner workings on a technical level so it's easy to understand and reuse my code.

With the exeption of any work done between the dates of 1/01/21-1/04/2021, this project should be completely finished by the end of 2020. As of September 26th, 2020, this is the final deadline for my project. There will be no further revisions after today to this schedule. If I do not meet a deadline, I will attempt to get the work done before the next deadline.
