# The documents
This folder contains a few things of note.
- The .tex files are the source for the PDFs. You likely don't need them.
- Most of the things in here are mirrors of their ManageBac counterparts. 
	- The "JournalEntries" PDF contains a log of every ManageBac journal entry.
	- The "Schedule" PDF contains the schedule for my project.
	- The "Proposal" PDF contains a copy of my proposal from ManageBac.
- Some, however, are unique to this Github:
	- The "Styleguide.txt" document outlines how C and Assembly should be written for this project.
	- The "Usage.txt" docuument outlines how someone might find this source useful, if at all.


These are provided so that people who cannot see my ManageBac can see the full details of my project.
You'll also need a (recent) version of TeXLive to build the .tex files.
