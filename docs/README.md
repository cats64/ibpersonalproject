# The documents
This folder contains a few things of note.
- The .tex files are the source for the PDFs. You likely don't need them.
- Most of the things in here are mirrors of their ManageBac counterparts. 
	- The "JournalEntries" PDF contains a log of every ManageBac journal entry.
	- The "Schedule" PDF contains the schedule for my project.
	- The "Proposal" PDF contains a copy of my proposal from ManageBac.
These are provided so that people who cannot see my ManageBac can see the full details of my project.
You'll also need a (recent) version of TeXLive to build the .tex files.
