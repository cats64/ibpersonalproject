C Source Guidelines for this project:

Always:
- use /* */ comments, and not //. 
- make sure that the code compiles before commit.
- properly format a function (move the opening and closing brackets onto their own line)

Never:
- include a *.c file. It's bad practice. Use a header to link them instead.
- use a lot of preprocessor directives. I try to avoid these as much as possible.
- use cute types, (e.x. creating something like deftype int MyOwnInt).

Sometimes:
- enum should be preferred over DEFINE. Use DEFINE for macros that cover the whole document.
- do a bounds check before writing to an array.
