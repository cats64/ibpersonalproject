C source guidelines for this project:

Always:
-Use // for TODO comments & one-line comments
-Only C99
-Use /* */ for serious comments & multiline comments
-Start the brackets like this:

int main(void) {
	printf("Some words here\n");
}

-Prototype functions with a *.h file in an include folder.

Sometimes:
-Use preprocessor directives sparingly.
-If in doubt, declare a size larger than needed, but check to see if a smaller one could work first

Never:
-Use preprocessor macros. These are dumb and should be avoided.
-Include a *.c file into another file.
-Use brackets like this:

int main(void) 
{
	printf("Some words here\n");
}
